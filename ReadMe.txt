The ReadWrite JSF is a library for presenting and/or toggling the input components of a JSF page between Read and Write mode.

The library uses custom tag, all tags inside which gain the behavior of toggling their behavior at render time. 
The behavior of each of the components is controlled by custom renderers which are also a part of the library.

Please feel free to try and suggest any improvements. Your thoughts and ideas are most welcome.
